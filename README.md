<h1>ENGLISH Description</h1>

### [ترجمه فارسی](README_fa.md)

<h2>This program can show you the info of dumped PS5 games</h2>
<h2>Features</h2>
- Read param.json File and display it on table (maybe **NOT ALL** Games, It's must be tested)<br>
- Detect whether the eboot.bin is fake or not (It just check the eboot.bin file not others)<br>
- Get the size of the game folder (Its HARD TO READ From Properties)<br>
<h2>Note 1: It can't show you the PKG files. Neither PS4/5 PKG, Only dump Folder of PS5 games (not ps4)</h2>
<h2>Note 2: THIS APP IS ON TEST So if find Any Bugs, mention me on <a href="https://x.com/sinajet1">X (Twitter)</a></h2>
